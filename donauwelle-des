    <p>
Donauwelle is a classic German cake with layers of vanilla and chocolate cake topped with cherries, custard, and a glossy chocolate glaze. It's as delicious as it looks!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) can pitted tart cherries in water, drained</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Custard Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
   
    </ul>
    <h3>Chocolate Glaze:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li1 1⁄3 cups semisweet chocolate chips></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
 
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong><liDirections></li></strong>
     <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9x13-inch baking dish with parchment paper.


     <li>To make the cake layers: Sift flour and baking powder together into a bowl; set aside. Beat 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in white sugar, vanilla extract, and 5 egg yolks. Stir in flour mixture until just combined</li>
     <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy; continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape.

</li>
     <liGently fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the batter, keeping as much volume as possible. Add the remaining egg whites, folding just until incorporated.></li>
     <li>Pour half of the batter into a separate bowl. Sift cocoa powder into one bowl of batter; stir until just combined.

</li>
     <li>Pour white cake batter into the prepared baking dish, then spread chocolate cake batter on top. Pat cherries dry with paper towels, and sprinkle them evenly on top.</li>
     <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes; set aside to cool.

</li>
     <li>To make the custard filling: Whisk cornstarch and 1/2 cup sugar together in a small bowl. Heat milk in a small saucepan just until hot but not boiling. Whisk in cornstarch mixture until smooth; bring mixture to a boil, whisking constantly, until mixture is thick and easily coats the back of a spoon, about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.</li>
     <li>Spread custard filling over cooled cake; press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the custard filling so it doesn't form a skin. Refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours to overnight.
     <li>To make the chocolate glaze: Place chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat at 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until just melted and smooth. Stir in oil until glossy.</li>
     <li>Spread chocolate glaze over chilled custard layer. When the glaze has set slightly, about 10 minutes, drag a fork lightly across the surface in wavy lines to create a wave pattern on the chocolate.</li>
     <li>Let glaze set completely before slicing cake into squares. Enjoy!

</li>
    </ol>
